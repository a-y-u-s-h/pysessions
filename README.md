# Pysessions
Storage for my creative python based projects. This may include occasional use of Python mode for Processing development environment, automation scripts, and lots of other tools which come up over time. I haven't really thought this through, so every project in this collections of projects will include a `README.md` which explains stuff about it. There's also a wiki. Plus there's a dedicated webpage for this series under development.
