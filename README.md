# Pysessions
Storage for my creative python based projects. This includes occasional use of Python mode for Processing development environment, automation scripts, and lots of other stuff which I learn over time as I swim through the world of Python. I haven't really thought this through, so every project in this collections of projects includes a `README.md` which explains stuff about it. There's also a wiki. Plus there's a dedicated webpage for this series under development.
